<p> This box simulates how. Weak passwords and an unpatched WordPress site can lead to a complete system takeover.  </p>  
 
<b> ENUMERATION:</b>
<hr>
<p> We’ll start by enumerating ports with a NMAP Scan.</p>
<img src="/img/blog/1.nmap-scan-1.png">
 
<p>Here are our results. We have Port 22 OpenSSH ver. 7.6, Port 80 Apache ver. 2.4.29, ports 139 and 445 SMB Samba. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/2.nmap-scan2.png">
 
<p>Let’s enumerate all ports with nmap. While we wait on these results, let’s take a peek at what's running on port 80 </p>
<img src="/img/blog/3.nmap-scan.png">
 
<p>We have a blog created by a guy named Billy. First thing I am taking note of is the username. A user named Karen Wheeler posted an article to this blog and we  can assume a user  by the name of  Billy Joel is the admin. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/4.blog-home-page.png">
 
<p>In the footer of the web page we can see that the CMS is WordPress -let’s note that too. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/5.blog-home-page-footer.png">
 
<p>Next, we can see that we’re able to post a comment, but it won’t show on the page until an admin approves it. Let’s Note this and keep enumerating. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/6.blog-home-page-reply.png">
 
<p>Let’s check the source code just to make sure we are dealing with a WordPress site and to make sure there’s no sensitive data exposure. Nothing stands out as low hanging fruit. Keep enumerating. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/7.blog-home-source.png">
 
<p>Here we can see the WordPress version running is 5.0, we may need to check this for known vulnerabilities. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/12.wordpress-version.png">
 
<p>The Nmap scan is back and it appears that we only have 4 open ports. Next, I’m going to enumerate for subdirectories and SMB shares </p>
<img src="/img/blog/8.Nmap-scan-3.png">
 
<p>Here I started Gobuster to find “hidden” subdirectories. While this is working Let’s enumerate the SMB shares. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/9.go-buster.png">
 
<p>Here I'm using SMBClient we see there're 3 shares 2 are default. I would expect to see those but the one that stands out is BillySMB.</p>
<img src="/img/blog/10.SMB-Shares.png">
 
<p>Here we can see the wordpress version running is 5.0, we may need to check this for known vulnerabilities. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/12.wordpress-version.png">
 
<p>Here I was successfully able to login to the share named BillySMB with the Guest account. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/13.smb-login-guest.png">
 
<p>Let’s download these files and see if there’s anything of interest … something tells me this is a rabbit hole :/ </p>
<img src="/img/blog/14.SMB-File-download.png">
 
<p>The png image was a QR code that sent you to a YouTube video (Billy Joel - We Didn’t Start The Fire) LOL.  Next. </p>

<p>The Alice-White-rabbit.jpg : /</p>
<img src="/img/blog/15.rabbit_hole.png">
<p>Back to WordPress. Let’s run wpscan to see if we can find any
 vulnerabilities.</p>
<img src="/img/blog/16.wpscann.png">
 
<p>After some research I did find some promising exploits in Exploitdb Crop-image Shell Upload but it requires user authentication. Since we know Billy Joel and KarenWheeler have access to post on the wordpress blog let’s see if we can find  a valid username for one of them.    </p>
<p>You can enumerate usernames in wordpress by navigating to login --> forgot password and typing a username. If it doesn't exist the error message will tell you. Honestly, I don’t know why WordPress still has this functionality. So we can see the user admin does not exist.  </p>
<img src="/img/blog/17.admin-user-try.png">
 
<p>I tried billy, billyjoel, karen, kwheeler, ect… none of these were valid. What I did find as valid usernames were bjoel and kwheel.</p>

<b> GAINING A FOOTHOLD:</b>
<hr>
 
<p>Ok I have a potential exploit, but it requires authentication.  Two usernames but no passwords. Brute Force attacks are always a last resort but given what I have to work with I think this the best course of action. Since, I don’t like to trem brute force attacks, I’m going to say I'm “testing” for weak passwords. To do this first I need to capture a failed login attempt post data.. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/19.failed-login-request.png">
 
<p>Now I’m going to use this post request with Hydra and the rockyou wordlist. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/20.Hydra-atack.png">
 
<p>Doesn't take long before we find karen’s password</p>
<img src="/img/blog/21.karen-password.png">
 
<p>Now that we’ve verified the WordPress credentials. Let's try the exploit. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/22.wp-login.png">
 
<p>To save time I’m going to use Metasploit instead of the manual method, but If you want to understand how this exploit works you can read about it here: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/wordpress-remote-code-execution-exploit-cve-2019-8942/ </p>
<img src="/img/blog/23.msfc-exploit.png">
 
<p>Set the password, Remote host, username, local host and port</p>
<img src="/img/blog/24.msfc-options.png">
 
<p>We have our first shell. Let’s enumerate and see if we can improve upon this. </p>
<img src="/img/blog/25.1st-shell.png">





<b> PRIVILEGE ESCALATION: </b>
<hr>
 
<p>Checking the SUID we see one that seems out of place named checker. Let’s check GTFO bins </p>
<img src="/img/blog/26.suid.png">
 
<p>GTFOBins has no data for this binary let’s see what it does.it gets the "admin" environment variable and prints out "Not an Admin".</p>
<img src="/img/blog/27.ltrace-checker.png">
 
<p> Let’s try and set the variable.</p>
<img src="/img/blog/28.env-checker-set.png/">
 
<p>Now let’s run it. And we’re root</p>
<img src="/img/blog/29.root-privesc.png">
 
<p>Find the user flag and cat it out.</p>
<img src="/img/blog/30.user.txt.png">
 
<p>And the root flag</p>
<img src="/img/blog/31.root.txt.png">
